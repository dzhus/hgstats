* PIPESPEC syntax
  PIPESPEC describes a sequence of filters to be applied to
  repositories.

** Rationale
   PIPESPEC syntax must meet the following requirements:
   
   - we want to easily write pipespecs by hand;
   - parsing must be simple;
   - do not allow anything tricky;
   - don't collide with shell syntax conventions.
     
** Current version
   Colon-separated list of filters sets the order of filter
   application. When just filter name is used, it's implied that the
   result of pipe-spec part to the left of colon is used for `stream`
   argument of filter. RepoStream for current repository is used for
   the first filter.

   : DiffstatFilter:AccFilter,

   The expression above roughly expands to:

   : AccFilter(DiffstatFilter(RepoStream(repo)))

   Additional filter arguments are specified just like in function
   calls but with `stream` argument omitted (because it's [[implied]]).
   Only numeric, string or boolean (True/False) values are allowed
   (don't be [[tricky]]).
   
   : DiffstatFilter(True):GroupingFilter(15,30):AccFilter

   expands to

   : AccFilter(GroupingFilter(DiffstatFilter(RepoStream(repo), True), 15, 30))

** TODO Implement [[PIPESPEC]] parsing
